Bing Wallpaper Changer
==================

This project was created from a desire to have the Bing image of the day as my desktop wallpaper, but not have to deal with Bing Desktop being psuedo-malware on my machine.

No flashy features here. I simply run as a scheduled task once a day.

It is configurable to the extent that you can choose to add the copyright text or not and select the style of display (stetched, tiled, etc.)

Works On My Machine!
